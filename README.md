# C# Complete Course

### Project

As I learn C# myself I will update this repo so others can follow the same path. Feel free to file an issue if you have concerns about methodology or bad practices.

---

### Disclaimer

As I am new to C# I can't guarantee that this course will contain all the best practices. It is my goal to update obsolete sections and practices so feel free to contact me directly or file an issue.

---

### Pedagogy

As of now I am still deciding on tailoring this course to people new to coding all together or to people who are already familiar to a OOP interpreted such as JavaScript.
I will probably settle on this as I go and update this section as soon as I feel it is set in stone.
